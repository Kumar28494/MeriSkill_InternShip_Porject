# PORJECT 2 -  “HR Analytics"
## Description: Examining and analyzing the employees' data to:

### Determine the rate of Attrition among team members.

## HR Analytics Report:

1.We have a total 1470 employee counts with an Attrition count of 237(16%). Based on the Attrition count, however:

2.The Male Gender covers 60%, with 150 counts of the total 237.

3.While the remaining 40% is dominated by the Female gender with 83 Attrition counts

4.The Age distribution presents that the attrition is major and common among the Youths and, most especially, 

5.Young adults within the age range of "18-30" and "31-45" respectively Marital Status, and by Gender, also further present the fact that attrition rate is higher among the Male employees. However, it is most common among the Singles, both Male and Female, followed by the Married, while the Divorced employees has a very few rate of Attrition.

## Attrition Rate by Employee Engagement
1.Employees with Low Performance has quite significant high attrition , while by Job involvement and Work-Life-Balance present a significant rise in attrition at the "Moderate" level. This implies that the attrition in these cases was caused by neither a poor nor excellent Job experience.

2.Job Overtime or not, also, does not seem to be a factor, yet there is nearly the same attrition rate in both cases, while employees located near the work environment has significant high attrition .
## Attrition Rate by Job Duty
Employees at the Entry Level has the highest attrition rate with 143 attrition counts, while the Senior and the Executive Level barely have attrition.
## Attrition Rate by Organization
1.Job and Relationship Satisfaction do not seem to have much influence in employee retention as, apparently, satisfied employees dominate the attrition in both cases. However, the Job Environment is a huge factor of the attrited employees are very dissatisifed with the environment.

2.Uncover the factors responsible for Attrition in specific organisations and the rate of Attrition as caused by those insights.

Create Visualizations to present findings effectively showing the ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets, enabling to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing business organisation.
